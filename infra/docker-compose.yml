Docker artifacts removed

This repository no longer includes a docker-compose-based development
workflow. The infrastructure folder previously contained a
`docker-compose.yml` used to run Postgres, backend and frontend. That
file has been removed — run backend and frontend locally as described in
the top-level `README.md`.

If you intentionally want to keep compose-based instructions, re-create
`infra/docker-compose.yml` from your preferred template. Otherwise this
project is now Docker-free by default.
